                The sun is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of plasma at the center of our solar system. Its gravity holds together everything from the biggest of planets to the tiniest debris in its orbit. Its age is approximately 4.5 billion years. The sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers from Earth), and without iits energy, life as we know it could not exist here.

                The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it, and its core reaches a temperature of upto 15 million degrees celsius. The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.

                The Sun has several regions. The interior regions include the core, the radiative zone, and the convection zone. Moving outward – the visible surface or photosphere is next, then the chromosphere, followed by the transition zone, and then the corona – the Sun’s expansive outer atmosphere.

                Once material leaves the corona at supersonic speeds, it becomes the solar wind, which forms a huge magnetic "bubble" around the Sun, called the heliosphere. The heliosphere extends beyond the orbit of the planets in our solar system. Thus, Earth exists inside the Sun’s atmosphere. Outside the heliosphere is interstellar space.

                <span class="header">Knowing about the Sun is important!</span> <br>
                The Sun is a normal star. It is much closer to us than any other star, and by studying the Sun, we can therefore learn more about other stars. The better we understand other stars, the more we know about the Milky Way. From there we know more about other galaxies and in the end we learn more about the universe.

                Our Sun is very dynamic and it changes constantly. It has the largest eruptions in the solar system. These eruptions can be so large that they can reach our planet and cause serious damage by disrupting satellites and other communication devices. Our TV may not work, our cell phones will be down, a high speed train may run loose and if an astronaut happens to be on the moon at the time when the Sun erupts, he or she would be in great danger.

                NASA uses satellites such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), to predict these eruptions so that we have a warning of at least 2-3 days to protect our expensive communication devices during a solar eruption. SOHO is just one of the instruments that NASA uses to help scientists understand our Sun better along with other satellites and large observatories on Earth.
